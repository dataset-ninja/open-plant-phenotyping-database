**OPPD: Open Plant Phenotyping Database** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the agricultural research. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the agricultural industry. 



The dataset consists of 6391 images with 228585 labeled objects belonging to 46 different classes including *PPPDD *, *PPPMM *, *CHEAL *, and other: *CONAR *, *1COMF *, *POLAV *, *SONOL *, *MATCH *, *MATIN *, *CENCY *, *PLAMA *, *SENVU *, *POLCO *, *SOLNI *, *CAPBP *, *CHYSE *, *SINAR *, *BRSNN *, *EROCI *, *MELNO *, *GERMO *, *LYCAR *, *PAPRH *, *GALAP *, *BROST *, *LOLMU *, *POLLA *, *RUMCR *, *MYOAR *, *ARTVU *, *POAAN *, *ALOMY *, *APESV *, *ANGAR *, *EPHPE *, *AVEFA *, *LAPCO *, *PLALA *, *CIRAR *, *EPHHE *, *POLPE *, *SONAS *, *FUMOF *, *STEME *, *3UNCLK*, and *1PLAK *.

Images in the OPPD dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 436 (7% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 40 splits in the dataset: *BROST* (141 images), *CENCY* (149 images), *LOLMU* (142 images), *EPHHE* (319 images), *POLCO* (144 images), *BRSNN* (140 images), *EPHPE* (145 images), *LYCAR* (152 images), *CAPBP* (149 images), *CHEAL* (305 images), *STEME* (51 images), *EROCI* (138 images), *CHYSE* (152 images), *FUMOF* (230 images), *GALAP* (150 images), *CIRAR* (256 images), *SINAR* (139 images), *CONAR* (252 images), *GERMO* (136 images), *PLAMA* (153 images), *MYOAR* (155 images), *MATCH* (154 images), *LAPCO* (140 images), *POLLA* (140 images), *SOLNI* (146 images), *PLALA* (117 images), *SONOL* (193 images), *POLPE* (120 images), *PAPRH* (134 images), *MATIN* (150 images), *POAAN* (139 images), *POLAV* (230 images), *MELNO* (146 images), *RUMCR* (140 images), *SENVU* (152 images), *ALOMY* (141 images), *ANGAR* (144 images), *APESV* (142 images), *ARTVU* (149 images), and *AVEFA* (116 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the [Aarhus University, Denmark](https://international.au.dk/) and [I-GIS A/S, Denmark](https://i-gis.dk/en-us/).
