**OPPD: Open Plant Phenotyping Database** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the biological research. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 6391 images with 228585 labeled objects belonging to 46 different classes including *PPPDD*, *PPPMM*, *CHEAL*, and other: *CONAR*, *1COMF*, *POLAV*, *SONOL*, *MATCH*, *MATIN*, *CENCY*, *PLAMA*, *SENVU*, *POLCO*, *SOLNI*, *CAPBP*, *CHYSE*, *SINAR*, *BRSNN*, *EROCI*, *MELNO *, *GERMO*, *LYCAR*, *PAPRH*, *GALAP*, *BROST*, *LOLMU*, *POLLA*, *RUMCR*, *MYOAR*, *ARTVU*, *POAAN*, *ALOMY*, *APESV*, *ANGAR*, *EPHPE*, *AVEFA*, *LAPCO*, *PLALA*, *CIRAR*, *EPHHE*, *POLPE*, *SONAS*, *FUMOF*, *STEME*, *3UNCLK*, and *1PLAK*.

Images in the OPPD dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 436 (7% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2020 by the Aarhus University, Denmark and I-GIS A/S, Denmark.
