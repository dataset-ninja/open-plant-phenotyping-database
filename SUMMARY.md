**OPPD: Open Plant Phenotyping Database - Full Images** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the biological research. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 7590 images with 315040 labeled objects belonging to 52 different classes including *PPPDD*, *PPPMM*, *CHEAL*, and other: *VERPE*, *CONAR*, *1COMF*, *VERAR*, *POLAV*, *SONOL*, *MATCH*, *MATIN*, *PLAMA*, *CENCY*, *SENVU*, *STEME*, *VICHI*, *POLCO*, *SOLNI*, *CAPBP*, *SINAR*, *CHYSE*, *BRSNN*, *MELNO*, *EROCI*, *VIOAR*, *GERMO*, *LYCAR*, *THLAR*, *URTUR*, *PAPRH*, *GALAP*, *RUMCR*, *BROST*, *POLLA*, *LOLMU*, *MYOAR*, *ARTVU*, *POAAN*, *ALOMY*, *APESV*, *ANGAR*, *EPHPE*, *AVEFA*, *LAPCO*, *PLALA*, *CIRAR*, *EPHHE*, *POLPE*, *SONAS*, *FUMOF*, *3UNCLK*, and *1PLAK*.

Images in the OPPD: Full Images dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 489 (6% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2020 by the Aarhus University, Denmark and I-GIS A/S, Denmark.
