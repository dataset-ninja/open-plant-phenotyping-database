**Open Plant Phenotype Database (OPPD)** - a publicly available dataset consisting of 7590 RGB images featuring 47 plant species. 
Each species undergoes cultivation under three distinct growth conditions, ensuring a diverse visual appearance. These images are gathered at Aarhus University, Research Centre Flakkebjerg, Denmark, utilizing a custom data acquisition platform that offers  images at a ground resolution of approximately 6.6 pixels per millimeter.

The dataset comes complete with annotations using the EPPO encoding system for plant species, bounding box annotations for plant detection and individual extraction, information about the growth conditions, and time elapsed since seeding.
